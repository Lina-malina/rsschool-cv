## Summary
My story as a junior developer has begun at the moment when I saw my friend coding something. At first I thought: "Oh my God, it's a magic!". The next moment I realized that I graduated from the medical univercity, so there is nothing impossible for me. I can study and I know how to study tons of information for a short period of time.

## Skills

## Code examples
Unfortunately, I have no real expirience in programming to show you my code examples, but here is a bubble-sort example :)
```javascript
function sort(array) {
    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        for (var j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
            if (array[i] > array[j]) {
                var temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[j];
                array[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
sort([3, 1, 5, 2]);
```
